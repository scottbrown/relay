*Information-oriented technical descriptions and specifications.*

Reference documentation provides technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. It's like an encyclopedia - dry, factual, and comprehensive.

- [Package Reference](packaging.md) - Technical details about RPM and DEB package structure, installation, and behaviour
- [ZPA LSS Specifications](../../spec/) - Log format details and examples
