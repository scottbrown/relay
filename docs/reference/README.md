# Reference

*Information-oriented technical descriptions and specifications.*

Reference documentation provides technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. It's like an encyclopedia - dry, factual, and comprehensive.

## Coming Soon

Planned reference documentation:

- Configuration File Reference
- Command-line Flags Reference
- API Reference (if applicable)
- File Format Specifications
- Performance Benchmarks
- Metrics Reference (Prometheus)
- Environment Variables Reference
- Exit Codes Reference

## Current Reference

For now, see:
- [Main README](../../README.md) for configuration options table
- [ZPA LSS Specifications](../../spec/) for log format details
