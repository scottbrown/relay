# Explanation

*Understanding-oriented documentation that clarifies and illuminates topics.*

Explanation documentation deepens and broadens your understanding of the project. It's about understanding *why* things are the way they are.

## Available Explanations

### [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](adr/)

Documentation of key architectural decisions made during the development of relay, including:

- Why we chose specific technologies
- Design patterns and their rationale
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Historical context for major decisions

See the [ADR index](adr/README.md) for the complete list.

## Coming Soon

Other planned explanation topics:

- Design Philosophy - Why relay is built the way it is
- Security Model - How relay approaches security and threat modeling
- Performance Characteristics - Understanding relay's performance profile
- Data Flow Deep Dive - Detailed explanation of how data moves through the system
