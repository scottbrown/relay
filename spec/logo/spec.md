# Relay Logo Concept

## Brand Essence

-	Purpose: Tiny Go service that accepts JSON log streams and relays them safely to Splunk HEC.
-	Qualities: lightweight, trustworthy, efficient, network-centric, security-minded.

## Visual Elements

1.	Core Symbol:
  -	A stylized arrow/packet moving through a small hub.
  -	Represents the “relay” behavior — data flowing in, being processed, and going out.
2.	Shape Language:
  -	Rounded edges, clean geometric forms (aligns with modern Go/SaaS visuals).
  -	Simple enough to scale down for a favicon / CLI icon.
3.	Log/Data Motif:
  -	Use stacked brackets {} or three small rectangles (like NDJSON lines) flowing into the hub.
  -	Outbound side shows them compressed into a single stream (→).
4.	Go Reference (subtle):
  -	A small hint of the Go gopher’s palette (teal/sky blue) — not the mascot, but a nod through color.

## Color Palette

-	Primary:
-	Cornflower Blue (#6495ED) → signal clarity, Go language tie-in.
-	Secondary:
-	Dark Grey (#333333) → stability, logs, infra.
-	Accent:
-	Splunk Green (#65A637) or Orange (#FF9900) (optional, to nod to Splunk ingestion).

## Layout Variants

-	Icon-only: Hub with inbound “lines” and outbound arrow.
-	Wordmark: “Relay” in a rounded sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Nunito).
-	Micro-icon (16×16): Simplify to just the outbound arrow through a small circle.

## Style

-	Minimalist / Flat (like other SaaS and CLI tools).
-	Abstract enough to avoid “log” clichés but recognizable as data movement.
-	Animation-friendly if later used on a dashboard (packets streaming through the relay hub).
